       integer :: pid        !%d !The process ID.
       character(10) :: comm !%s !The filename of the executable, in parentheses. This is visible whether or not the executable is swapped out.
       character :: state    !%c !One character from the string "RSDZTW" where R is running, S is sleeping in an interruptible wait, D is waiting in uninterruptible disk sleep, Z is zombie, T is traced or stopped (on a signal), and W is paging.
       integer :: ppid       !%d !The PID of the parent.
       integer :: pgrp       !%d !The process group ID of the process.
       integer :: session    !%d !The session ID of the process.
       integer :: tty_nr     !%d !The tty the process uses.
       integer :: tpgid      !%d !The process group ID of the process which currently owns the tty that the process is connected to.
       integer*8 :: flags      !%lu !The kernel flags word of the process. For bit meanings, see the PF_* defines in <linux/sched.h>. Details depend on the kernel version.
       integer*8 :: minflt     !%lu !The number of minor faults the process has made which have not required loading a memory page from disk.
       integer*8 :: cminflt    !%lu !The number of minor faults that the process's waited-for children have made.
       integer*8 :: majflt     !%lu !The number of major faults the process has made which have required loading a memory page from disk.
       integer*8 :: cmajflt    !%lu !The number of major faults that the process's waited-for children have made.
       integer*8 :: utime      !%lu !The number of jiffies that this process has been scheduled in user mode.
       integer*8 :: stime      !%lu !The number of jiffies that this process has been scheduled in kernel mode.
       integer*8 :: cutime     !%ld !The number of jiffies that this process's waited-for children have been scheduled in user mode. (See also times(2).)
       integer*8 :: cstime     !%ld !The number of jiffies that this process's waited-for children have been scheduled in kernel mode.
       integer*8 :: priority   !%ld !The standard nice value, plus fifteen. The value is never negative in the kernel.
       integer*8 :: nice       !%ld !The nice value ranges from 19 (nicest) to -19 (not nice to others).
       integer*8 :: num_threads !%ld !This value is hard coded to 0 as a placeholder for a removed field.
       integer*8 :: itrealvalue!%ld !The time in jiffies before the next SIGALRM is sent to the process due to an interval timer.
       integer*8 :: starttime  !%lu !The time in jiffies the process started after system boot.
       integer*8 :: vsize      !%lu !Virtual memory size in bytes.
       integer*8 :: rss        !%ld !Resident Set Size: number of pages the process has in real memory, minus 3 for administrative purposes. This is just the pages which count towards text, data, or stack space. This does not include pages which have not been demand-loaded in, or which are swapped out.
